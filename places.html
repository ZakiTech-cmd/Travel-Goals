                    The City of London is a city, ceremonial county and local government district that contains the historic centre and constitutes, alongside Canary Wharf, the primary central business district (CBD) of London.

                  <p>
                    The City is now only a small part of the metropolis of Greater London, though it remains a notable part of central London.
